/**
 * @summary Logic for validating a bidAccepted sale
 * @description
 * A wrapped punk bid can be accepted on RaribleExchangeV1.
 * 	- Example: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x26ad41d72737442ef108460bc25a69764b30e3df96344d95f8f3a03a551fd787#eventlog
 * 	- We know this through the buyer address.
 *     - The major difference between this sale and a regular sale is that
 *         - the owner address in Ordermatched becomes the buyer --> (toAccount)
 *         - the seller address becomes the buyer --> (fromAccount)
 * 	- RaribleExchangeV1 takes 2.5% fee on all bids accepted transactions so we need to remove that to get the actual sale price
